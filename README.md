## 💡 Profile

Developer since 2007, my strongest experience is in the .NET world, working from .NET 1.1 to .NET Core. I have always been more interested in architecture, design patterns, best practices, and testing than coding itself. I have a questioning profile regarding adopted architectures, always analyzing if, as a team, we are considering all options and their pros and cons. I care deeply about maintainability and coupling levels, not just feature delivery. I foster a strong culture of testing, mainly unit tests, which helps with maintenance and future refactoring.
